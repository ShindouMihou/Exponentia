### ü•≥ Motivation

Recently (as of writing), there was a realization within me that the spelling community **LACKS** a simple, straightforward and beautiful spelling test or a quizlet of some sort. I, who was almost dragged into the spelling bee at our school, wanted to find a solution to this odd gap in the community, and the play store had no real choices with most of them containing ads.

So, what if... we made something close to [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) and made it into spelling-oriented. That was how this came to life.
